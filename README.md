Project title: Prediction-of-Fire-radiative-power-during-forest-fires-using-Linear-regression

◦ Building Linear regression model by performing feature selection and scaling.
◦ Selection of proper basis function and computing mean squared error by using both analytical and gradient
descent iterative solution.
◦ Analyzing the accuracy by using proper regularization, stopping criteria and early stopping.
