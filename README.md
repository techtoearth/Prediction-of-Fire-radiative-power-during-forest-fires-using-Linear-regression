Project title: Prediction-of-Fire-radiative-power-during-forest-fires-using-Linear-regression

Linear Regression model from scratch was used to predict Fire radiative power based on dataset collected from two satellites terra and aqua. Dataset is recorded from fire in forests of australia.

◦ Building Linear regression model by performing feature selection and scaling.
◦ Selection of proper basis function and computing mean squared error by using both analytical and gradient
descent iterative solution.
◦ Analyzing the accuracy by using proper regularization, stopping criteria and early stopping.
